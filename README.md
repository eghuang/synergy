CRAN package prototype for synergy theory methods. Previously used for analyzing ionizing radiation tumorigenesis and chromosome abberations outside low-earth orbit, but may be applicable to other uses. The methods found in this repository are described in [Huang et al., (2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00411-018-00774-x) and [Ham et al., (2018)](https://www.rrjournal.org/doi/full/10.1667/RR14948.1).
